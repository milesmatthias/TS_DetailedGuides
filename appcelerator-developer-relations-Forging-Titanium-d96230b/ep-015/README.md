## Forging Titanium Episode 15: Twisti Part 2 - 3D with Three.js**Editors note: This and future episodes of Forging Titanium are available [here](http://vimeopro.com/appcelerator/forging-titanium).**In [Part 1 of the Twisti app series][] we created a native Android module that listened for sensor data. This sensor data was then transformed into 3 values, azimuth, pitch, and roll, which represented the physical orientation of the mobile device.In Part 2 we'll take that transformed data and use it to represent a mobile device as an animated 3D model. This 3D model will be rendered in a &lt;canvas&gt; element via a Titanium [WebView](http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.UI.WebView-object) with the help of the open source Javascript 3D engine, [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js). With this, Twisti is quickly becoming a powerful mix of native functionality and cross platform compatibility.### Episode Resources:* [twisti-ep015 app on Github](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Forging-Titanium/tree/master/ep-015/twisti-ep015)* [Twisti module on Github](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Forging-Titanium/tree/master/ep-014/Twisti)* [Three.js on github](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)* [Forging Titanium Episode 14: Twisti Part 1 - Android Module](http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/11/forging-titanium-episode-14-twisti-part-1-android-module.html)* [Building Native Mobile Applications - Integrating Web Content](http://vimeopro.com/appcelerator/building-native-mobile-applications/video/26415168)[Part 1 of the Twisti app series]: http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/11/forging-titanium-episode-14-twisti-part-1-android-module.html
