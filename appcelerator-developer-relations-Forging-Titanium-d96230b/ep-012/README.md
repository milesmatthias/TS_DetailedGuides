## Forging Titanium Episode 12: Titanium & Date.js

To keep the ball rolling on integrating existing Javascript libraries with Titanium, this week's episode shows off the Date.js library in a cross platform mobile app. We'll include this powerful date and time processing library, in a modular manner, to enhance the native Javascript Date object. Ideally, you'll let Date.js do all the grunt work of parsing disparately formatted dates while you spend your valuable time adding much more interesting features to your Titanium apps.
