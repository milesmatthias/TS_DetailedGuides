## Forging Titanium Episode 11: Titanium & Underscore.js

As Titanium developers, we are constantly looking for ways to not only increase our ability as mobile developers, but as Javascript developers as well. Wrapping your head around powerful utility libraries like [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) and using them in your own code is one important step in that direction.

In this week's episode of "Forging Titanium" will be taking a look at how we can use Underscore.js to quickly handle one of the most common tasks in any app: data normalization. We'll see how our code can be made more concise and expressive through the use of Underscore's many useful functions. In the end we'll have a simple, cross platform, table-driven app whose code is easy to read and maintain.
