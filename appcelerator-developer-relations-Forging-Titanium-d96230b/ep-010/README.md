## Forging Titanium Episode 10: Forms

The most common way for users to enter data into a web application is via forms. Well, as mobile developers we want the same familiarity for our users, along with ease of configuration on our end. With the multitude of native UI components available to Titanium developers, sometimes creating this seemingly simple interface can be a more intimidating task than expected. 

In this episode of Forging Titanium we'll look at how we can use CommonJS patterns to develop a simplified interface for creating cross platform mobile forms. We'll carefully abstract the underlying functionality of forms and expose only the critical functions and properties necessary to process them via a CommonJS module.
