## Forging Titanium Episode 16: Twisti Part 3 - Sockets **Editors note: This and future episodes of Forging Titanium are available [here](http://vimeopro.com/appcelerator/forging-titanium).**In [Part 1 of the Twisti app series][] we created a native Android module that listened for sensor data. This sensor data was then transformed into 3 values, azimuth, pitch, and roll, which represented the physical orientation of the mobile device. In [Part 2](http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/11/forging-titanium-episode-15-twisti-part-2-3d-with-threejs.html) we took that transformed data and used it to represent a mobile device as an animated 3D model with [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) in a Titanium WebView &lt;canvas&gt;. In this third and final episode in the series, we'll create a client/server relationship with [Titanium Sockets](http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP-object.html). We'll create an android device that will act as a sensor proxy, serving its physical orientation to connected clients. Those clients will represent the remote sensor as a 3D model, just as in Part 2.### Episode Resources:* [twisti-ep016 app on Github](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Forging-Titanium/tree/master/ep-016/twisti-ep016)* [Twisti module on Github](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Forging-Titanium/tree/master/ep-014/Twisti)* [Forging Titanium Episode 14: Twisti Part 1 - Android Module](http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/11/forging-titanium-episode-14-twisti-part-1-android-module.html)* [Forging Titanium Episode 15: Twisti Part 2 - 3D with Three.js](http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/11/forging-titanium-episode-15-twisti-part-2-3d-with-threejs.html)* [Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP API Docs](http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.Network.Socket.TCP-object.html)* [Appcelerator Wiki: Sockets](http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Sockets)* [Appcelerator Blog: Intro to Sockets](http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/05/titanium-mobile-intro-series-sockets.html)* [Building Native Mobile Applications - Integrating Web Content](http://vimeopro.com/appcelerator/building-native-mobile-applications/video/26415168)* [Three.js on github](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)[Part 1 of the Twisti app series]: http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/11/forging-titanium-episode-14-twisti-part-1-android-module.html
