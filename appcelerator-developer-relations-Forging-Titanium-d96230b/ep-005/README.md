# Episode 5: Parse - A Simple Back End Server for Mobile Applications

In this week's episode, we'll be taking a look at Parse, a new service which allows developers to quickly and easily set up persistent back end data services for their application.  This is particularly useful for mobile applications that aren't terribly concerned with back end business logic, like games or utility applications.

While Parse is still in beta and has a few kinks that need to be worked out, it's definitely a project worth tracking, and is super easy to use in Titanium.  Find out how to use a simple Parse client in this week's episode of Forging Titanium.
