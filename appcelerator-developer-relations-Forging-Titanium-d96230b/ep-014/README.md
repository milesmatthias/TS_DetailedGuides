## Forging Titanium Episode 14: Twisti Part 1 - Android ModuleThis week's episode of Forging Titanium will be part 1 in a 3 part series. In this series we will be creating a fun little experiment called **"Twisti"**. In this app we'll be taking on a whole host of advanced Titanium features, as well as leveraging both platform specific and web-based development capabilities. We'll touch on native Android module development, 3D rendering and animation in WebViews, and realtime communication via sockets.Today, though, we'll specifically be covering how to create a native Android module for use in our Titanium apps. This module in particular will be a souped up version of the core `Titanium.Accelerometer` module. We will not only return accelerometer data, but also data regarding the magnetic field of the device so we can determine its physical orientation.If that doesn't sound exciting enough for you, then perhaps you'll want to stick around for the sneak peek at Part 2 at the end. There we'll show you a demo of how this data can be used to render a 3D animated version of your phone right in a Titanium WebView! ### Episode Resources:* [Twisti module on Github](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Forging-Titanium/tree/master/ep-014/Twisti)* [twisti-ep014 app on Github](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/Forging-Titanium/tree/master/ep-014/twisti-ep014)* [Android Module Development Guide](http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Android+Module+Development+Guide)* [Titanium Command Line Interface Guide](http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Titanium+Command+Line+Interface)* [titanium_mobile/android/modules on github](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium_mobile/tree/master/android/modules)
