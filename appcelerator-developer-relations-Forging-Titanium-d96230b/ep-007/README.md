In this week's episode, we'll be taking a look at <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a>, a cloud-based service for adding telephony features to applications through a RESTful web service API.  Using Twilio, developers can send and receive phone calls and SMS text messages, enabling the creation of interfaces that pass beyond the reach of smart phones.

Learn how to send and receive phone calls and text messages in your mobile applications in this week's episode of Forging Titanium.
